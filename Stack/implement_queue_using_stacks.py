Implement Queue using Stacks
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

Constraints:

1 <= x <= 9
At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
All the calls to pop and peek are valid.
Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

# Initalize/Push/Empty Time Complexity: O(1) due to using constant time for each operation
# Peek/Pop Time Complexity: Amortized O(1) due to on average, will use constant time to pop or peek
# Space Complexity: O(N) due to storing all elements of the queue in either stack1 or stack2
class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = []
        self.stack2 = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.stack1.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.stack1 and not self.stack2
